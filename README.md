# dfiaddress.org
JavaScript Client-Side DeFiChain Wallet Generator

Now defichain addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently
generated in a web browser.

## End User Notes

 1) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.

 2) Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 3) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.

 4) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.

 5) BIP38 most likely will not work on mobile devices due to hardware limitations.
